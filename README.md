Had time. Went mad. Did some data entry relating to the Carddass Fullmetal Alchemist Alchemic Card Battle (Japanese trading card game, no relation to the American one).

You'll see all of the consistent data values from the cards in a relatively machine-readable format. Headings are vague but shouldn't be too hard to follow, and some redundant data was skipped (you can tell if you're looking at a "BATTLE", "CHARACTER" or "EVENT" card from the serial number, and you can tell whether you're looking at a "MAIN CHARACTER" or "SUPPORT CHARACTER" by whether it has AP/DP values). The key that I used for the attributes in the bottom black lines is in another file. Nothing has been checked.

Card information was dodgily scraped from online singles listings (Won't include my scripts for that here. If you can use them, you can make better yourself). I've included my list of filenames, which mostly gives the listing numbers that they were taken from (you'll have to guess whether it was Ebay, Mercari or Yahoo Auctions for some). Cropped images from the bottom of files (just the legible ones) are included, hopefully not enough to catch legal attention. I haven't run them through OCR or anything because there wouldn't be much point.

Notes for the would-be collector/scraper/peruser:
-342 unique cards from the regular sets, plus at least 17 promos (for tournaments I think), and ~36 alt art reprints of existing cards in the last few packs. I have found all but 37 in various listings. Apparently they also printed the very rare cards with different backgrounds depending on whether you got them from a vending machine or a pack from a store, but that is not worth anyone's time.
-There's a parallel set of non-game trading cards that I didn't do anything with.
-The DS game is for the American TCG. No relation.
-You can find singles for most cards from an Ebay search of "fullmetal" "alchemic" "C-126" (substitute C-126 for your own card's serial number).

Site that I was linked to for the private trade of these and other similar cards. It's where I got my list of names from. Note that it isn't complete (inferred from a listing for SPB-001). Don't know if they're still active.
